## Description

This project is a RESTful API built using Node and Express. The purpose of this project is to provide a Backend for a Wunderlist 2.0 web application. User registration, login, todo creation, deletion, fetching, or editing, are all handled here. This project was deployed on `Heroku`.

- The server is run using Node.
- Express is a minimalist Node web application framework for building APIs.
- PostgreSQL is the database used for production. SQLite3 was used for development and testing.
- Knex is a SQL query builder for JavaScript.
- Knex Cleaner is a Knex dependency for cleaning up seed data.
- Jsonwebtoken is used for authenticating users.
- Bcrypt is used for hashing passwords.
- Helmet adds a base layer of security by hiding basic info about the API when interacting with it.
- Dotenv allows the server to interact with environment variables.
- Cors is a dependency used to allow Cross Origin Resource Sharing. This allows the Frontend client to interact with the Backend.
- Cross-env allows the developer to set environment variables in a script.
- Jest is the library used for writing tests.
- Supertest is the dependency used for making "requests" in jest tests.

## Restrictions
If you would like to make a request to the todos or users endpoint, a valid JSON web token is required in your request headers.authorization. This token is acquired by successfully registering an account or logging in. Also, for testing to run successfully you will have to remove the authentication piece of middleware from the todos route in the server.js file.
